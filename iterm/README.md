# iTerm

During the setup process, Solarized color scheme will be installed into your iTerm. Go to Profiles => Colors => Load Presets to pick Solarized Dark.

Here are the customisations:

- Font: 15pt Source Code Pro for Powerline
- Theme (not to be confused with zsh theme): Solarized Dark
- Set up a system wide hotkey for iTerm (Keys => Hotkey): Recommended `Cmd-Escape`
- Uncheck `Use Lion-style full screen` on General. This will give you fast full screen windows that are switchable without switching to spaces
- Cursor (my favourite tweak): #d13a82
