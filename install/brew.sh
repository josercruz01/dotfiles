# - Languages: rbenv (Ruby), nvm (Node.js)
# - Databases: Progres, MySQL, Redis, Elasticsearch
# - Fuck (https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck): Correct your previous command. Note
#   that this needs to be added to zsh or bash. See the project README.
# - git-extras (https://vimeo.com/45506445): Adds a shit ton of useful commands #   to git.
# - autojump (https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump): a faster way to navigate
#   your filesystem.
# Note that I install nvm (https://github.com/creationix/nvm) instead
# of installing Node directly. This gives me more explicit control over
# which version I'm using.
